# Youtube2MP4

DEPENDENCIES: Must install pytube library 

You use the from pytube import YouTube function to import the Python Pytube library before continuing with the other aspects. Then you define the function download link.

The youtubeObject = youtubeObject.streams.get_highest_resolution() command will automatically download the highest resolution available.
Then I implemented the Try and Except to return an error message if the download fails â€“ else it will print out that the download is completed successfully.

The Link function will ask for the preferred YouTube video link to download, then immediately after you hit the enter button, the video downloading will commence.

Progress Bar: pytube allows you to hook into the download process with a callback function. You can use this to update a progress bar.

Download Directory: You can specify the download directory in the download() method.

The show_progress_bar function is a callback that updates the progress of the download. It calculates the percentage of the download and prints it.
The download function now takes an additional parameter path which is the directory where the video will be downloaded.
The YouTube object is created with an on_progress_callback set to show_progress_bar.
The download method of the video stream is called with output_path set to the desired download directory.
Make sure your terminal supports carriage return (\r) for overwriting the progress line.
If you run into any issues with the progress display, you might need to adjust the output method depending on your terminal or console.
Use `os.path` and `os.environ`: These modules can help you construct the path to the user's Downloads folder in a platform-independent way.
Platform Detection: You can detect the operating system and construct the path accordingly.
The get_download_path function determines the path to the Downloads folder. It handles both Windows and Unix-like systems (like Linux and macOS).
For Windows, it uses the winreg module to get the path from the Windows registry.
For Unix-like systems, it assumes a default downloads folder in the user's home directory. Note that the folder name is case-sensitive and may vary (e.g., 'Downloads' vs 'downloads').
This script should now work on different machines, automatically saving the downloaded files to the user's Downloads folder.
