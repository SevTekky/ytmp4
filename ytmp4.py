#You use the from pytube import YouTube function to import the Python Pytube library before continuing with the other aspects. Then you define the function download link.
#
#The youtubeObject = youtubeObject.streams.get_highest_resolution() command will automatically download the highest resolution available.
#Then I implemented the Try and Except to return an error message if the download fails â€“ else it will print out that the download is completed successfully.
#
#The Link function will ask for the preferred YouTube video link to download, then immediately after you hit the enter button, the video downloading will commence.

#Progress Bar: pytube allows you to hook into the download process with a callback function. You can use this to update a progress bar.

#Download Directory: You can specify the download directory in the download() method.

#The show_progress_bar function is a callback that updates the progress of the download. It calculates the percentage of the download and prints it.
#The download function now takes an additional parameter path which is the directory where the video will be downloaded.
#The YouTube object is created with an on_progress_callback set to show_progress_bar.
#The download method of the video stream is called with output_path set to the desired download directory.
#Make sure your terminal supports carriage return (\r) for overwriting the progress line.
#If you run into any issues with the progress display, you might need to adjust the output method depending on your terminal or console.
#Use `os.path` and `os.environ`: These modules can help you construct the path to the user's Downloads folder in a platform-independent way.
#Platform Detection: You can detect the operating system and construct the path accordingly.
#The get_download_path function determines the path to the Downloads folder. It handles both Windows and Unix-like systems (like Linux and macOS).
#For Windows, it uses the winreg module to get the path from the Windows registry.
#For Unix-like systems, it assumes a default downloads folder in the user's home directory. Note that the folder name is case-sensitive and may vary (e.g., 'Downloads' vs 'downloads').
#This script should now work on different machines, automatically saving the downloaded files to the user's Downloads folder.
